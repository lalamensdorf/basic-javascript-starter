# basic-javascript-starter

We'll explore JavaScript by changing the file `program.js` and reloading the `index.html` in our browser to rerun the script and see the result. `program.js` is already set to load in `index.html` through use of the `<script>` element.

`program.js` is a file we store JavaScript code in, as indicated by the `.js` file extension. The filename extension tells us (and the web browser) to expect JavaScript code.

In `program.js`, I've already created a variable I named *message*. I indicated I wanted to create a variable with the name *message* by first typing the keyword *var* followed by a space, then the word *message* followed by a semicolon. Those three elements (the *var* keyword, my chosen name *message* and the semicolon) were all needed to declare my variable.

You'll see sentences between `/*` and `*/`, which may appear as grey text in a code editor. This is a comment area (marked by the opening `/*` and closing `*/`), allowing us to keep notes along with our code.

I have placed instructions in these comment areas. Read the comments in `program.js` and alter the code as advised to try out different JavaScript expressions.
